# Demo scenes

+ **01 Runtime editor**  
The runtime editor demo is a great demonstration of how you can make use of 
several runtime methods to modify a map at runtime.
It has basic functionality like: fill, clear, save, load and generate a map. 
So it is a great way to use it as a base for your own editor.

+ **02 Village & 02 Village L-System**  
The village scene comes in two different version, one builds the roads around the houses and the other scene makes use of the L-system algorithm
which creates a road like map structure.

+ **03 Rooms**  
  Simple scene which creates walls and inner walls. You can use the paint generator in the first `OuterWalls` blueprint layer to modify the rooms.

+ **04 Platformer**  
  A great way to show how TileWorldCreator can be used without tile presets. Instead of tiles, this scene uses simple object build layers to instantiate the platforms object based on the blueprint map. This scene also demonstrates nicely how you can make use of the selection rule modifier.

+ **05 SciFi**  
  Demonstrates the scifi tile preset. The Scifi tiles uses PBR materials.

+ **06 Cliff Island**  
  Demonstrates the cliff island preset.

+ **07 Dungeon & 07 Dungeon Game**

  The dungeon game demo scene demonstrates a simple game with the use of player start and end position.  

+ **08 2D Island**  
  Demonstrates the 2D Island preset and how you can use TileWorldCreator for 2D games.
  
+ **09 Ramps**  
This demo demonstrates how to add custom tiles like ramps on specific positions.

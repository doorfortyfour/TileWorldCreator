# Custom action
In TileWorldCreator, an action is either a generator or a modifier. The main difference between a generator and a modifier is, that a generator is basically a function/algorithm which creates a map from zero, while a modifier modifies an existing map and returns the modified map. 
It's quite easy to create custom actions for TileWorldCreator.

# Generators

Generators are actions which creates a map based on an algorithm.
TileWorldCreator has multiple algorithms built in but you can of course also implement your own.


## Cellular Automata

## BSP Dungeon

## L-System

## Maze

## Random Noise

## Paint
The paint generator allows you to easily paint a map in the scene view. 
1. Add a paint generator to your layer. 
2. Enable the paint generator by clicking on the brush icon. 
3. In the scene view you can now start adding or removing tiles by holding Left Ctrl key and holding the left or right mouse button. 
4. When enabling the paint layer, the scene view registers the paint layer and allows you to easily enable / disable the paint layer from the scene view.

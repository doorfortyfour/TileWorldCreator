## Getting started

> To create your first map you'll need two asset files (scriptable objects) a **TileWorldCreator Asset** and a **TileWorldCreator Tiles Preset**.

First create a **TileWorldCreatorAsset** in your project.
1. Right click in the project window and select: **Create -> TileWorldCreator -> New TileWorldCreator Asset**  
2. Create a new empty scene and add a new GameObject to your scene.  
3. Add the TileWorldCreator component to it.  
4. Now assign the newly created TileWorldCreator Asset file to the empty slot of the TileWorldCreator component.
